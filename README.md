# Capstone-Project-Analyzing-Apple-Stock-Data

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. In this project, we aim to analyze Apple Inc.'s stock data to gain insights into its historical performance and trends. This readme provides an overview of our project, the problem statement, our proposed solution, the repository structure, and information about our team members.

## Problem Statement

The problem we are addressing in this project is to analyze and understand the historical performance of Apple Inc.'s stock. Specifically, we aim to answer questions such as:

- What is the historical stock price trend of Apple Inc.?
- Are there any noticeable patterns or fluctuations in the stock price?
- Can we identify key events or factors that influenced Apple's stock performance?
- What insights can we gain from historical stock data that may be relevant for investors and stakeholders?

## Solution

For this project, we will employ various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into Apple's stock data. We plan to use Python, including popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. The following models and methods will be employed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** We will start by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure its quality and consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through EDA, we will visualize the historical stock prices, analyze trends, and identify potential outliers or anomalies.

3. **Time Series Analysis:** We will use time series analysis techniques to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends in the stock data.

4. **Statistical Modeling:** To make predictions and gain further insights, we may employ statistical models or machine learning techniques.

5. **Visualization:** Throughout the project, we will create informative visualizations to help convey our findings effectively.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data.csv:** This file contains the dataset we used for our analysis. It includes historical Apple Inc. stock price data.

- **notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through our data analysis process. You can follow our analysis step by step by exploring these notebooks.

- **visualizations:** In this directory, you will find the visualizations we created to represent the data and our findings.

- **documentation:** This section holds any additional documents, such as research papers, references, or additional resources used during the project.

- **results:** We will include the final results and conclusions of our analysis in this directory.

- **requirements.txt:** This file lists the dependencies and packages required to run our analysis code.
